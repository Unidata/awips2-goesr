         Level 2 product colormap for Smoke
    -->
    <!-- TOWRdocs Description
         This colormap displays a single color (middle row) for use in Smoke High/Med/Low
         confidence product.  This product is a new product not in the 17.x or 18.1.x baseline, in which
         DQFs are invoked separately for the good quality fields, High/Med/Low on a single display from the
         menu.  The color (blue) corresponds to field values of 1.  The first entry labeled in the styel rules as "no smoke" and the last
         entry is labeled in the stylerules as no data.

         GOES-R colormaps were previously under Sat/GOESR-L2, and referenced as such in 
         the menus and style rules.  Based upon feedback from the SET, this file and
         similar color maps have been moved to a new path called GOES-R/GOESR-L2.
