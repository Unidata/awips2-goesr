    <!-- TOWRdocs Description
         Distribution file for GOES-R CMI and Level2 products. Added IXT.. expressions to recognize
         WMO headers for derived products.  The following headers are recognized: 

         IXTA - Aerosol Detection (ADP)
         IXTB - Aerosol Optical Depth  (AOD)
         IXTC - Volcanic Ash Detection/Height (VAH)
         IXTD - Cloud Top Phase (ACTP)
         IXTE - Hurricane Intensity
         IXTF - Rainfall/QPE  (RRQPE)
         IXTG - Cloud Top Height (CTH)
         IXTH - Clear Sky Mask (CSM)
         IXTI - Cloud Top Temp (CTT)
         IXTJ - Fire Hot Spot Characterization (FDC)
         IXTK - Land Sfc (Skin) Temp (LST)
         IXTL - Fractional Snow Cover (FSC)
         IXTM - Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
         IXTN - Derived stability indices (DSI)
         IXTO - Total Precipitable Water (TPW)
         IXTP - Legacy Vertical Moisture Profile (LVM)
         IXTQ - Legacy Vertical Temperature Profile (LVT)
         IXTX01 - Cloud Top Pressure
         IXTY01 - Cloud Optical Depth
         IXTW01 - Cloud Particle Size
         IXTX - Cloud Top Pressure
         IXTY - Cloud Optical Depth
         IXTW - Cloud Particle Size

         The WMO headers for GLM (IXTR) and derived motion winds (DMW,IXTU) are 
         not included here, but are located in separate distribution files as part of separate plugins.
         An entry for Himawari imagery is also included, here, used in testing.

          12/12/2016 Updates ABI match pattern to account for:

         "OR" = OE Real-Time Data
         "OT" = OE Test Data
         "IR" = ITE Real-Time Data
         "IT" = ITE Test Data"
